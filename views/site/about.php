    <p class="lead">News websites are sites devoted to delivering the news in a different format than television, print or radio. News sites include sites that have a large variety of information which may not be considered "news" by all audiences, but may include entertainment, games, news that may not be current but is interesting, or other miscellaneous information. An example of a site like this is MSN.com.</p>
    <p class="lead">Another type of news site is the site that is completely devoted to news. These sites may include all types of news like political, judicial, entertainment, sports or more. An example of this type of site is CNN.com.</p>
